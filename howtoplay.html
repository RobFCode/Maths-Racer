        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        <p>
          Select the Times Tables which you would like to practice (At least 1 Times Table needs to be selected).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        <p>
          Select the Car which you would like to race with by clicking the small blue car which is surrounded by 
          a white line. This will show a list of available cars which you can use to race with. Once you have chosen
          the car you would like to use, simply click on it and the selection will close and update your Car.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        <p>
          Select the number of Questions which you would like to answer during the Race. You can select between
          10 to 50 questions.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        <p>
          Select the number of minutes for the race length. You can select between 1 minute to 10 minutes for 
          each Race. This is the amount of time it will take your opponent to reach the finish line. You will need
          to get all questions correct to reach the finish line before this time limit.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        <p>
          Select the type of Race that you would like to do. This will decide what types of questions you have
          to answer during the race. Multiplication Questions, Division Questions or Both Types of Questions.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        <p>
          Click the 'Start Race' button to begin the race.
        </p>
        <p>
          After clicking the Start Race button it will disappear, scroll the screen down to allow a better
          view of the Race Track & Questions, then begin the 3 second Countdown & Start Lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the countdown the Race starts and you will automatically be taken to the first question. After you 
          have attempted each question and moved out of the answer box, the game will check the answer provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the answer is correct, it will change to Green and your Car will move forwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the answer is not correct, it will change to red and you will have to go back and re-answer the
          question. After you have re-answered it and moved out of the answer box it will be checked again to
          see if it is now correct, if not it will remain red.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to answer all questions correctly before the opponent reaches the finish line to win the race.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <p>
          If using a keyboard with a number pad on the right hand side, use your ring hand on those numbers to
          answer all of the questions, then use 'TAB' to move to the next question down with your left hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start off with a longer Race Length Time and gradually shorten the time as you improve.
