# Maths-Racer

Maths Racer is an online browser based game which has been designed and created to assist Primary School Children to practice their Times Tables. The idea is to provide some fun in the learning process so that it's engaging for children and helps push them to improve both the speed and accuracy of the answers to the times table questions.

It has been created to allow the opportunity of practicing Multiplication, Division or Both. The available times tables range from 2 to 12. The amount of questions is between 10 to 50, as I felt that more than 50 questions would be too many for a single 'Race'. The current race time lengths are between 1-10 Minutes to allow for enough variation against the number of questions being attempted.

As a parent, I did not want to keep printing out sheets of paper with questions for my child to practice on and wanted to make the process of learning fun and engaging. The idea of racing against a timed opponent adds an element of pressure to the game to help children develop speed in answering the questions, and the theory is that by being able to practice answering quickly and accurately, the child will develop the ability to instinctively know the answer to times table questions.

I decided to create this game and make it available for free online so that any parent / child can access and use it. I know there are other tools available to help practice times tables, however many require a subscription or contain excessive advertising, something you will not have to put up with here.
