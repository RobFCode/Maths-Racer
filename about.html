        <h3>What is Maths Racer?</h3>
        <p>
          Maths Racer is an online browser based game which has been designed and created to 
          assist Primary School Children to practice their Times Tables.
          The idea is to provide some fun in the learning process so that it's 
          engaging for children and helps push them to improve both the speed
          and accuracy of the answers to the times table questions.
        </p>
        <p>It has been created to allow the opportunity of practicing Multiplication, 
          Division or Both. The available times tables range from 2 to 12. The amount of 
          questions is between 10 to 50, as I felt that more than 50 questions would
          be too many for a single 'Race'. The current race time lengths are between 1-10 Minutes
          to allow for enough variation against the number of questions being attempted.
        </p>
        <h3>Why was it created?</h3>
        <p>
          As a parent, I did not want to keep printing out sheets of paper with questions for
          my child to practice on and wanted to make the process of learning fun and engaging.
          The idea of racing against a timed opponent adds an element of pressure to the game to help
          children develop speed in answering the questions, and the theory is that by being able to
          practice answering quickly and accurately, the child will develop the ability to instinctively
          know the answer to times table questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to create this game and make it available for free online so that any parent / child
          can access and use it. I know there are other tools available to help practice times
          tables, however many require a subscription or contain excessive advertising, something you
          will not have to put up with here.
        </p>
        <h3>Are further features to be added?</h3>
        <p>
          Further features will likely be added in the future, and are likely to include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The inclusion of Addition and Subtraction for younger children who have not 
              yet progressed onto Multiplication or Division.
            </li>
            <li>
              High Score Feature where players will be awarded a score based on the difficulty of 
              questions / number of times tables attempted and how quickly they win the race. They will
              then have the opportunity of providing a nickname (will be asked not to provide a real name)
              and the top 20 will be displayed on a High Scores Leaderboard.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
